<b>Readable-Password-Generator</b><br />

The aim of this project is to build a program that will generate passwords that resemble real letter combinations in order to make them easier to remember.
To do that, the program first begins by recording the frequency at which one letter follows letter (or special characters - includes ".", ",", "!" etc.) from a text.
We record this within a central 3-dimensional structure, which is then used to produce the random passwords.<br />

The logic behind building this project is that it's close to real world applications. For instance, this idea can be used to make auto-correctors on phones.
Phones have very little processing power and storing space, and have to work with efficient algorithms that don't take much memory.
